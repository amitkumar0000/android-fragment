Base Activity and Headless Fragment
------------------------------------
To hold common code , that being used by different activity .
Base Activity can be used.
Base activity is a activity without any layout. All common code can be written here.

Problems with Base Activity
    if project grow bigger and bigger. Base Activity code will keep increasing.
    Some feature may not be used by some activity and need to take care of this.
    Base Activity overhead will keep increasing.

    Helper class can come to resuce here. but helper class are not activity life cycle aware.
    Also context or activity instance need to pass helper class. which may cause memory leak.

    Best solution is Headless Fragment.
    Headless fragment  is effective helper class with life cycle aware as it is attach to activity.


To create Headless Fragment
--------------------------
Create a Fragment without any layout
and call setRetainInstance(true) in onCreate() method of Fragment.
